# HairCam-Final
The final physical computing prototype

This is the final prototype for my thesis project. 
It is a physical computing project that enables a web server to read and write signals from the front web interface through links. 

The project contains two parts, a schematic graph and a folder with an Arduino.io document. 

Please donot copy the code for any business purposes.

However, I am happy if the codes could inspire you to get into creating interactive projects.
